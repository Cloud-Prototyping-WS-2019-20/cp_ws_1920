# Protocols
## Meetings/Calls
- Physical meeting with Jacob on Tuesdays, after the meeting with Jacob we check the state of the stories/tasks and propose the next ones for the week.
- Call on Saturdays at 2:00pm to sync and see the state of the members of the group and tasks. 

## Stories
On tuesdays we discuss the features or improvements our tool should have as well as how to implement it. Once everything is agreed a Story must be added as issue explaining what we want to add following the template. The story should have a list of tasks and a criteria to be closed.

## Tasks
After creating a story, subsequent tasks must be defined. For each task in the story list we must create a new issue using the task template. These tasks should be explained and detailed in a way that anyone can take it and have enough information to fulfill it. If anyone thinks the task issue is not clear enough, please feel free to edit the task issue and improve the information. If anyone have the task not clear even with the information, please notify in the group chat in slack to seek help or to discuss details that still need to be clear.

### Types
- If the task is a research task, the assignated person should limit the time she/he is investing in the research (time limit to be discussed) and provide in the comments of the task all the information she/he has found with sources. If possible, the assinated person should suggest a way of applying the solution. E.g. I found out that the formula to optimize the results is this one, I suggest to add this formula in the script X to treat Y information.
- If the task is a programming task, the assignated person should submit a PR with the solution filling the template given, if possible provide the test output of your solution. The PR must be reviewed by at least 2 members of the group to be merged. Once the reviews are done, the assignated person should be notified and she/he must proceed to merge the PR.

## General Communication
In general we will communicate via Slack. 
**Fail fast!** If anyone is stuck with a task implementation, please communicate in the group chat and provide the correct information to help: Context, Environment, Steps to reproduce, related internet sources to your problems and possible fixes you may have found. WARNING: this does not mean to execute your task fast and without the time it requires, requesting help should be done if you see no more solutions to your problem.
**Feel free to improve!** Everyone has edition access to the issues to change stories and tasks. If the change implies an implementation change PLEASE notify in the group chat, the whole group must agree.
**Open for suggestions** The management is not perfect and can be improved, if you have any issues or want to propose any change feel free to discuss with the group!
